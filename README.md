## How to build the game

We are using [Scons](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/m/mobile.action#page/29004846), a python based "Makefile". 

Download and follow the instructions in their readme to get Scons installed. You will need python to be on your system already (check documentation).

From there, open a terminal in the root directory (the same one as README.md) of the project. Type the following:

```
scons
```

This should build the game into a executable called "CatBalls" (I would love to change this in future versions, just saying - Davin)

## How to launch
The provided code does not include a working game from the onset. The game needs to be compiled on your machine.

In order to compile the game open your console of preference in the same directory as README.md and type the following:

```

To Be Added, scons script or Makefile(linux only)?

```

To play the game:

```

To Be Added, run the executable created or add a subscript "make play" or "make run"

```
